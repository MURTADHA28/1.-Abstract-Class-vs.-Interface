Abstract Class: When you want to create a common structure and default behavior for a set of classes then use this. For example, we can say take any type of pizza but those require three steps of preparation while different in baking.

Interface: To be used when you want to define a contract for unrelated classes to implement common methods, but do not specify how the methods have to be implemented. Eg: In the electric appliance example, all appliances should implement turnOn and turnOff methods:: but how it is implemented can vary.
